# **Word-Connect**
## **Purpose**

I created this website to be able to play a game similar gameshow called only connect hosted by the bbc. This Website focuses on the final round of the game show only connect where a 4x4 grid of jumbled words appear and the players have to find out which four words are linked together and what links them together.

**Word-Connect** offers a experience similar to only connects final round so users can play the game without going onto the show themselves. Users get a final score to at the end of the game and also have the ability to add games to the website through the sumbission form page.
